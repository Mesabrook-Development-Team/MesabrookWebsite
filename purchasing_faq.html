				  What's a Purchase Order & why is it important?
			  </h5>
			</div>
			<div id="collapseOne" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-parent="#accordion">
			  <div class="card-body border border-light">
				<p>A Purchase Order is how businesses order items from each other. It defines the Seller and the Buyer, the date the order was made, the products and/or services being ordered, and the cost for each. In addition, a Purchase Order will have <strong>Fulfillment Plans</strong> associated with it to define how the product will be delivered from the Seller to the Buyer. See more about Fulfillment Plans below.</p>
				<p>Purchase Orders are important for a number of reasons:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Organization:</strong> If your business, or the Sellers business, makes a lot of purchases/sales, it can be extraordinarily difficult to keep track of all your active orders. This can be especially true if you're only shipping small parts of an order at a time. Purchase Orders allow you to keep your orders organized and keep track of how much product you've shipped and how much you have yet to fulfill.</li>
					<li><strong>Special Pricing:</strong> By utilizing the <strong>Quotes</strong> system, you can request special pricing for your purchases, and a Purchase Order will ensure you get that pricing. They also protect you from price changes that may occur after your order has been accepted, ensuring you're only paying for what you were quoted.</li>
					<li><strong>Automation:</strong> Purchase Orders open the the door for a wide host of automation. By using the <strong>Purchase Order Template</strong> feature, recurring Purchase Orders can be made quickly and efficiently not only through the MesaSuite UI, but also through API calls. Purchase Order Approvals can also be setup to auto-approve by Sellers and Carriers for unchanged, recurring Purchase Orders to streamline your business-to-business operations.</li>
					<li><strong>Invoice Clarity:</strong> Invoices now integrate with the Purchase Order system to make it clear that the product you're paying for is related to a purchase you made. MesaSuite automates the creation of these Invoices based on the Shipper's preference to reduce the burden on Shippers and to ensure the accuracy of bills on Buyers.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>While this is only a small highlight, there are many other benefits to the use of Purchase Orders in MesaSuite!</p>

			  </h5>
			</div>
			<div id="collapseTwo" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingTwo" data-parent="#accordion">
			  <div class="card-body border border-light">
				<p>A Fulfillment Plan lays out exactly how the Purchase Order Lines will be delivered to a Buyer from a Seller. Lets take a look at each field and define what they mean:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Railcar:</strong> A railcar <em>or</em> a Lease Request that is to be associated with the transport of freight as defined by this Plan. Selectable Railcars can either be those that the Buyer currently owns or is leasing, or those that the Seller owns.</li>
					<li><strong>Purchase Order Lines:</strong> A selection of one or more Purchase Order Lines the specified Railcar will be hauling</li>
					<li><strong>Pickup Track:</strong> This is the track in which the Railcar will be destined for when it needs to be loaded with one of the associated Purchase Order Lines.</li>
					<li><strong>Strategic Track after Pickup:</strong> This is the track the Railcar will have its Strategic Destination set for after it's been loaded by the Seller.</li>
					<li><strong>Drop Off Track:</strong> After the Railcar has been loaded with a Fulfillment, this is the track in which the Destination will be set on the Railcar.</li>
					<li><strong>Strategic Track after Drop Off:</strong> Similar to <strong>Strategic Track after Pickup,</strong> this is the track the Railcar will have Strategic Destination set for after the Fulfillment has been received by the Buyer. <em>Note:</em> this will only occur if there is a remaining quantity for the Purchase Order Line(s) this Railcar is designated to haul.</li>
					<li><strong>Destination after Fulfillment:</strong> Once a Fulfillment has been received by the Buyer, and there are no remaining quantities to be shipped that this Railcar is designated for, then this track will be assigned to the Railcar's destination.</li>
					<li><strong>Railcar Routing:</strong> This is an <em>ordered</em> chain of companies that this Railcar will be handled by in order to get Purchase Order Lines from the Seller to the Buyer. It's important that this route is in the correct order from start to finish. Note that each company listed in the route will need to approve this Purchase Order before it can be accepted.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Fulfillment Plans are an extremely useful tool as this information will tell MesaSuite exactly how to automate the Railcar through the system between the Seller and Buyer. Except in unique cases (such as Service-typed Purchase Order Lines or Purchase Orders not requiring rail service), Fulfillment Plans should always be used to ensure a smooth fulfillment service.</p>
				<p>Sellers, Buyers, and Carriers (those called out on the Railcar Routing) will likely need to collaborate together to complete these Fulfillment Plans in order to fill them out completely. If this Purchase Order will be used multiple times, then this is typical a one-time collaboration effort as the same plan is generally followed subsequently without change.</p>

			  </h5>
			</div>
			<div id="collapseFour" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingFour" data-parent="#accordion">
			  <div class="card-body border border-light">
				<p>A Bill of Lading is similar to a Fulfillment in that it also tracks freight within a Railcar, but it has a fundamentally different purpose. Bills of Lading are issued automatically by the Seller to a specific Carrier as the Railcar changes hands along its route. This is why the Railcar Routing portion of a Fulfillment Plan is important. The Bill of Lading acts as a contractual agreement that the Carrier has the right to move the Railcar, and carriers with it the responsibility completing its role in the Railcar's route.</p>
				<p>Bills of Lading must be manually accepted by the Buyer when the Railcar arrives to the Buyer. This is to certify that the Buyer has received the freight as indicated by the Bill of Lading.</p>
				<p><strong>Note:</strong> Bills of Lading are <em>only</em> issued for Railcars when they are actively carrying a Purchase Order Fulfillment. They are <em>not</em> issued for return trips to the Seller, trips to the post-fulfillment Destination, or for any other purpose.</p>
				<p>Bills of Lading can be printed through OpenPrinters to have a physical copy while in-game utilizing the Network Print option in MesaSuite.</p>

			  <div class="card-body border border-light">
				<p>Suppose you want to order product from a Seller that they don't have pricing for, or you feel you should be receiving a bulk discount. You can request a Quote from any Seller for any Item and indicate how much product you wish to purchase. This is known as a Quote Request.</p>
				<p>Quote Requests being received by Sellers can have one of two actions performed on them: they are either deleted, or turned into an actual Quote.</p>
				<p>Quotes are issued to Buyers and have expiry date/times. They can also be marked as a one-time use Quote, or they may be reused repeatedly until the Quote expires. Quotes contain Items with a designated price per unit, and a minimum required quantity of that Item in order to qualify for the quoted price.</p>
				<p><strong>Note to Sellers:</strong> all items in a Quote <em>must</em> be in your regular Price Manager in order to add the item to the Quote.</p>

				<p>Access to the Purchasing & Fulfillment system is on a Location by Location basis. Therefore, for each Location you wish to use the system in, you must add the Employees who should have access to the system and check the <strong>Manage Purchase Orders</strong> box and click Save. Note that at the time the feature was released, all pre-existing Employees who had access to Manage Invoices were automatically given access to Manage Purchase Orders.</p>
				<p>After you've been given access, you'll want to set up the items you'll be selling to any potential buyers. This can be done by going to the Finance menu, expanding Purchasing & Fulfillment, and clicking Price Manager. In the Store Items window, you can begin adding the Items you wish to sell and set their prices. <strong>Note:</strong> if your location operates in-game store operations, the prices for products are shared between those operations and purchasing.</p>
				<p><strong>That's it!</strong> You're now ready to begin sending and receiving Purchase Orders. In order to see this list, go to the Finance menu, expand Purchasing & Fufillment, and click Purchase Orders. This will open the Purchase Order Explorer which will show you all of your received and sent Purchase Orders throughout their various statuses.</p>

				<p>When a Seller approves a Purchase Order, they are presented with a special tab regarding how payment will work in regards to the Purchase Order.</p>
				<p>The first option is in regards to <em>when</em> Invoices will be issued to the Buyer. This can be upon shipment (when the Fulfillment is created), upon delivery (when the Fulfillment is marked as Delivered), or manual (no automatic Invoice creation, it must be done by the Seller.)</p>
				<p>The second option is the Account to be used as the Receiving Account on any Invoice that's automatically created.</p>
				<p>If upon shipment/delivery is selected, and an Account is specified, then Invoices will automatically be issued to the Buyer on behalf of the Seller.</p>

			<div id="collapseEight" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingEight" data-parent="#accordion">
			  <div class="card-body border border-light">
				<p>Because there are many different ways businesses load freight into railcars, there are a variety of options available to you to create a Fulfillment.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If your business has railroads spotting railcars on your property to load/unload at your leisure, you may find that the Shipping/Receiving option is easiest for you. This can be found under the Finance menu, expand Purchasing & Fulfillment, and click Shipping & Receiving. This will provide you with a list of toggleable Tracks and Railcars. On the right-most pane, MesaSuite will try to find and pre-fill the best fit Purchase Order Line to load, and the recommended quantity to be loaded into the car. Once you have finished loading the car, click the Finalize Loading button. When you're ready to release the car to the first carrier according to the associated Fulfillment plan, click the Release To button. The car will then be removed from the list.</li>
					<li>If you have a specific car, track, or Purchase Order in mind, you may find the Fulfillment Wizard more convenient. This can be found under the Purchasing menu, expand Purchasing & Fulfillment, and click the Fulfillment Wizard option. This will start a new Wizard where you can select railcars you wish to load. On the following page, MesaSuite will provide its best guess as to which Purchase Order you should fulfill, and it's recommend quantity to load into the car. The next page allows you to determine whether or not you want to immediately release the railcar to the first carrier on the Fulfillment Plan. Completing the wizard will commit the Fulfillments and releases you specified.</li>
					<li>If neither of these options work for your use case but you do know which Purchase Order you'd like to fulfill, you can open the Purchase Order through the Purchase Order Explorer. On the bottom portion of the Open Purchase Order window is a Fulfillments pane. Clicking the arrow next to the Fulfillment Wizard button will present to you an option to manually add a Fulfillment to a railcar.</li>
				</ul>

			  </h5>
			</div>
			<div id="collapseNine" class="collapse" aria-labelledby="headingNine" data-parent="#accordion">
			  <div class="card-body border border-light">
				<p>Once a railcar has arrived at your property, you will want to verify the associated Bill of Lading matches what's in the railcar before you unload it. Once unloaded, you'll need to mark it as unloaded in MesaSuite and send it on to it's next leg of the journey.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>MesaSuite does provide an easy interface to manage all of your cars that you're receiving. This can be found under the Finance menu, expand Purchasing & Fulfillment, and click Shipping & Receiving. This will provide you with a list of toggleable Tracks and Railcars. On the right-most pane, MesaSuite will present to you a variety of information for each Railcar:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>At the top, all of the loads in the associated Railcar and allow you to clear them individually.</li>
							<li>Below the list of loads, an option is available to clear <em>all</em> loads en masse rather than having to click Clear on each.</li>
							<li>Next, MesaSuite presents you with the associated Bill of Lading number which can be clicked to view the document. If the Bill of Lading has yet to be accepted, a link is available to accept it from this page.</li>
							<li>Next, a link to complete the receiving process. Ultimately this option will set the values on the associated Railcar to either return to the Seller for another round, or proceed to the post-fulfillment destination if Purchase Order Lines no longer have any remaining quantity.</li>
							<li>Lastly, a link to release the railcar back to the <em>last</em> carrier on the Fulfillment Plan Railcar Routing is selectable. Clicking this link will remove the Railcar from the list.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If you prefer a more manual approach to things, you can view all of the Bills of Lading associated with your Company as a Buyer, Seller, and Carrier, as well as historical Bills of Lading. This is located by clicking the Finance menu, expanding Purchasing & Fulfillment, and clicking the Bills of Lading menu. From here you can get a Bill of Lading Number. When you're ready to accept an active Bill of Lading, you can either click the Accept Bill of Lading button, or click the Finance menu, expand Purchasing & Fulfillment, and click the Accept Bills of Lading option.</li>
					<li>After this, you may process railcar loads like you would have previously, and release the railcar back to the railroad that shipped the car to you.</li>
					<li><strong>It is recommended to utilize the Shipping & Receiving option as it takes full advantage of automation that is in place.</strong> The other menus are available primarily as a backup and work around should the primary method of receiving railcars fail.</li>

				<p>Yes! As a Buyer, you can save any Purchase Order at any time as a Purchase Order Template. This will allow you to effectively clone your Purchase Order, Purchase Order Lines, and Fulfillment Plans into a new Purchase Order which can be submitted for approval. This can be done by either creating a new Purchase Order and clicking Load Template at the top, or by clicking the drop down arrow next to New Purchase Order on the Purchase Order Explorer and clicking the From Template button. Sellers and Carriers have the option to auto-approve Purchase Orders that are cloned in this way in the future to streamline procurement.</p>
				<p><strong>Be warned,</strong> significant changes to the Purchase Order (such as quantities or track selections on Fulfillment Plans) will effectively force your Purchase Order to have to go through the approval process again, even if the Seller and Carriers have indicated they want to auto-approve future Purchase Orders.</p>

			  <div class="card-body border border-light">
				<p>Thanks to the automation provided by Fulfillment Plans, cars will now be able to have their strategic destinations set right out of the gate when customers release cars to you. This is also true of live loading situations - once cars have had their Fulfillments added to them, the strategic destination will be updated on the fly. Train crews should refresh their Train Viewer consist tab to view updated Strategic Destination values.</p>
				<p>Because wrong values can be disruptive to your operation, any Purchase Order that involves your company in a Railcar Routing will require your approval before it goes into effect. This gives you the opportunity to send the Purchase Order back to the Buyer to make any required changes to the Fulfillment Plan.</p>
				<p>Additionally, a Route tab has been added to the Railcar viewer. This allows you to see which company the railcar should be going to next and you can set strategic destinations as needed to meet this goal.</p>
				<p>Bills of Lading are issued to you by Sellers, so be sure to review those to see what your role is in your contractural obligation to continue the railcar on its journey.</p>

			  <div class="card-body border border-light">
				<p>No. Railroads should continue to utilize their existing processes when it comes to charging their customers. However, Bills of Lading <em>do</em> show the value of the loads in each railcar, which could provide another paradigm in your Accounts Receivable strategy.</p>
